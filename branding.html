		 <h1> The Process On Making A Logo  </h1>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <p> I created a logo out of the name Templar s initials using Adobe Illustrator. I used the pen tool to edit and adjust color, the rectangle tool to create the logo's boxes, and the polygon tool to create the triangles. The colors I selected were yellow, black, and green for one of the logos.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="imagesforseniorportfolio\Hexa.jpg"  alt="image" /> </div>
        <p> The first one has the s behind the t and is shaped like a hexagon. </p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="imagesforseniorportfolio\dia.jpg"  alt="image" /> </div>
        <p>The second logo is a diamond-shaped one with a gray portion for the t and a yellow one for the s.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="imagesforseniorportfolio\ts.jpg"  alt="image" /> </div>
        <p>The third logo consists of boxes that form a yellow and black s and t.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="imagesforseniorportfolio\green.jpg"  alt="image" /> </div>
        <p>The t and s are the fourth log; the t has two pieces, is on top of the s and is green and yellow, while the s is on the bottom and is black, giving the logo the appearance of a hut.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="imagesforseniorportfolio\TRianle.jpg"  alt="image" /> </div>
        <p>The final logo utilizes the polygon tool to make a triangle by positioning the s in front of the t. It is triangular in shape, yellow and black, and incorporates these colors.</p>
		<br> 
        <br>
        <h1> My logo </h1>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <p> In the creation of the name Templar s' initials were used in Adobe Illustrator to create a logo that is straightforward and pleasing to the eye. To make my logo more aesthetically pleasing when viewed, I utilized the colors white, green, red, blue, purple, and yellow and for the colors to pop a black background was used. I formed the t and s using the rectangle tool, making sure to keep them as even as possible. </p>
