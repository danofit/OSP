    <a>In the final design, the text wraps around the pictures and the text is connected, showing the contrast between the pictures. The titles are in bold.</a>

    <a>For the first one, there is a similarity in putting one letter upside down and connecting both to make a diamond shape. The second one demonstrates figure and ground as it is enclosed in an 'o'. The third one showcases continuity as the M's are in a line and copy each other. The fourth one represents closure as it makes a shape by moving the L's sideways and inverting them. The last one illustrates proximity as the F's combine to make a circle in the center.</a>

    <a>The first image has a main point with the text on one side and the other text surrounding it. The second one shows the placement of the text and evenly distributes it. The third one is like a box circle but is empty on the corners and in the middle, demonstrating various placements of the text. The fourth one shows order between the text and creates a shape like a fist. The last one is a creeper face from Minecraft, which shows the text forming the shape of the face and the order of the text.</a>
