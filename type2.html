      <a> For the first one is similarity as putting one letter upside down and connecting both make a diamond shape. The second is figure and ground as it is enclosed in a o. The third is continuity as the M's are a in a line and and copy each other sine i lined them together like that to make the pattern. The forth closure as it makes a shape that makes another  i moved the L's side ways and inverted them. The last one is proximity as is F's to make a circle and combined in the center.
